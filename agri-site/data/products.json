    "shortDescription": "Potato starch is the starch extracted from potatoes. The granules of potato starch are roughly twice the size of those from other starches, resulting in significantly higher water absorption capacity and improved texture. It is a highly refined starch, containing minimal protein or fat, which gives the flour a clear white color. When cooked, potato starch exhibits neutral taste, good clarity and transparency, high binding strength, a long texture, and a minimal tendency to foam.",
    "description": "Potato starch is a very refined starch, containing minimal protein or fat. This gives the powder a clear white colour, and the cooked starch typical characteristics of neutral taste, good clarity, high binding strength, long texture and a minimal tendency to foaming or yellowing of the solution. It is used in food industry, for example to keep the cake moist and give a soft texture. It is also occasionally used in the preparation of pre-packed grated cheese, to reduce sweating and binding. It is also used in nonfood applications as wallpaper adhesive, for textile finishing and textile sizing, in paper coating and sizing, and as an adhesive in paper sacks and gummed tape.",
